# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-09

### Changed
- Restructured Terraform into versioned environment layout (sandbox, dev, qa, prod)
- sandbox environment uses local backend — runs manually from laptop
- dev, qa, prod environments use Azure remote state — pipeline only
- Each environment is self-contained with its own backend, providers, variables, and outputs
- Updated `plan.md` Phase 3 to reflect versioned module strategy over workspaces

### Added
- `deployment/app_service/VERSIONING.md` — documents versioning strategy, folder structure, git tag convention, and promotion flow

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- `deployment/` folder structure with `app_service/`, `common_instructions.md`
- `deployment/app_service/plan.md` — end to end App Service deployment plan
- `deployment/app_service/execution_log.md` — sequential log of all steps performed
- `deployment/azure_details.md` — local only, git-ignored, stores Azure credentials reference
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude `deployment/azure_details.md` and `.env`
- Phase 1 complete: Azure CLI, Terraform, GitHub CLI verified and updated
- Phase 2 complete: Service Principal created, Contributor role assigned, GitHub secrets set, Terraform remote state storage created (rg-wings-tfstate, stwingstfstate, tfstate container)

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- `family` and `vendor` Django apps with protected dashboards

- Login modal on homepage with email/phone input, Get OTP button, Login with Google and Login with Microsoft buttons
- Role selector (Family / Vendor) in login modal — mandatory before any login action
- `wings/adapters.py` — custom allauth adapter redirects to correct dashboard based on session role
- `wings/views.py` — `google_login_with_role` view stores role in session before Google redirect
- `.env` support via `python-dotenv` — Google credentials stored securely, never committed
- `CLAUDE.md` — code conventions: function-based views only, `uv run` for all commands, never commit `.env`
